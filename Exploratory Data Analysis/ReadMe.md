# User Churn Analysis - Waze App

## Overview

Hello everyone! Welcome to the User Churn Analysis for the Waze App! This repository documents my extensive exploration into user behavior and churn rates within the Waze application. It's a culmination of efforts to understand user engagement, identify potential factors behind churn, and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Purpose

My goal throughout this analysis was to delve deep into understanding user churn within the Waze app. By scrutinizing various user-related metrics and behaviors, I aimed to unravel patterns, correlations, and reasons contributing to user attrition. This analysis serves as a compass to guide the Waze team in devising better user retention strategies and enhancing the overall app experience.

## Key Findings

### Unveiling User Behavior
- **Distribution Insights:** The data revealed intriguing patterns in user behavior metrics. Some metrics displayed heavy right-skewed distributions, suggesting that most users tended toward lower values. Others showed uniform distributions, indicating an even spread of values across the range.
- **Data Quality Notes:** While most data seemed reliable, certain metrics had outliers or inconsistencies, like 'driven_km_drives' and differences between monthly variables like 'activity_days' and 'driving_days.'

### Understanding Churn Factors
- **Churn Rate Discovery:** The data showcased a churn rate of less than 18%, indicating a strong user retention rate.
- **Correlation Exploration:** I found a positive correlation between distance driven per driving day and churn, implying that users covering longer distances were more likely to churn. Conversely, a negative correlation existed between the number of driving days and churn.

### User Base Representation
- **Diverse User Tenure:** The analysis revealed a balanced representation of users across different tenures, from newcomers to those with a tenure of about 10 years, indicating a diverse user base.

## Next Steps

Building upon these insights, I'm eager to take the following steps:
- Collaborate closely with the data team to address any data quality concerns or inconsistencies observed in specific metrics.
- Investigate further into the sudden surge in app usage among long-term users during the last month to uncover potential causative factors.
- Develop tailored strategies to bolster user retention by leveraging identified correlations and user behavior patterns.

## Conclusion

This User Churn Analysis serves as a guidepost, illuminating crucial aspects of user behavior and churn rates within the Waze app. It lays the groundwork for strategic planning, empowering the Waze team to refine user retention strategies and elevate the overall app experience. By leveraging these insights, we aim to create a more engaging and satisfying journey for our users.
